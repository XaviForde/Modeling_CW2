\section{Introduction}

This paper is based on solving the transient diffusion-reaction equation given by equation \ref{eq:MAIN}.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:MAIN}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}    = D\frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2} + \lambda c + f
\end{equation}


\section{Part 1: Software Verification}

\subsection{Question 1a}
\subsubsection{Introduction}

A transient Diffusion-Reaction solver was developed and used to solve the specific transient equation give by equation \ref{eq:q1a}. This is the same equation as \label{eq:MAIN} with $\lambda = 0$ and $f = 0$. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:q1a}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}    = \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}

The equation is subject to the following domain, boundary conditions and initial conditions.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
x &= [0,1] \\
t &= [0,1] \\
c(x,0) &= 0 \\
c(0,t) &= 0 \\
c(1,t) &= 1
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

The analytical solution of equation \ref{eq:q1a} for the above conditions is given by equation \ref{eq:q1aAnal}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:q1aAnal}
c(x,t) = x + \frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n} e^{-n^2\pi^2t}\text{sin}(n\pi x)
\end{equation}



A Crank-Nicolson time stepping scheme was used with the recommended time step of $\delta t = .01$ and a 10 element mesh. The result produced using the finite element method is compared to the analytical solution for $ t = 0.01, \ 0.10, \ 0.20, \ 1$ as shown by Figure \ref{fig:q1a}. The FEM solver incorporates the option of quadratic basis functions and so this solution has been plotted in Figure \ref{fig:q1aquad} alongside the linear basis function solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:q1alin}. The difference between the quadratic and linear solutions is hardly noticeable in these plots and both provide a good approximation to the analytical solution. It is clear that the FEM solutions converge on the analytical solution as time increases with the plots indistinguishable at $t = 1$ where the steady state solution has been approached.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Investigation of Time Stepping Schemes}

The times stepping schemes used were Backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson. The results at $x = 0.8m$ for over the time range have been plotted both time stepping schemes at time steps of $\Delta t = 0.1s$ and $\Delta t = 0.025s$ in Figures \ref{fig:q1b05} and \ref{fig:q1b025} respectively. With a time step of $\Delta t = 0.1s$  the Crank-Nicolson scheme is showing oscillatory solution whereas the Backward Euler scheme does not oscillate. The oscillatory response of the Crank-Nicolson reduces with time and even at the large time step is more accurate over the time domain than the Backward Euler scheme. As the time step is reduced to $\Delta t = 0.02s$ the oscillation of the Crank-Nicolson scheme is much reduced as is again clearly more accurate that the Backward Euler scheme.

\subsection{Investigating the L2 Norm}

The L2 norm is the error of the FEM solution compared to the analytical solution. As the $L_2$ Norm is investigating the error in the  spatial domain the time step had to be very small to make the time error insignificant. As a result only low resolution meshes could be tested to keep computing time reasonable. Equation \ref{eq:l2norm1} shows how the exact solution $CE(x)$ is approximated by the FEM solution $C(x)$ with an additional higher order terms truncated. For linear basis functions the lowest order truncated term, n,  is $n = 2$, and similarly for quadratic basis functions $n = 3$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:l2norm1}
CE(x) = C(x) + O(h^n)
\end{equation}

The error $E(x)$ is $CE(x) - C(x)$ and by rewriting the higher $O(h^n)$ as $Gh^n$, where $G$ is a constant, equation \ref{eq:l2norm1} can be written as equation \ref{eq:l2normgrad}. It can be seen that as the error converges with increasing mesh resolution the gradient of the a logarithmic plot of these should be $n$. 


\begin{equation} \label{eq:l2normgrad}
log(E(x)) = log(G) + n*log(h)
\end{equation}

The $L_2$ norm was calculated for mesh sizes of 5 to 12 elements and plotted as shown in Figures \ref{fig:q1l2o1} and \ref{fig:q1l2o2} for linear and quadratic basis functions respectively. The gradients were computed to be -1.97 and -2.88 for linear and quadratic plots respectively. This shows that the $L_2$ norm is converging as the gradients match the expected $n$ values of the truncated terms.

\section{Part 2: Modeling and Simulation Results}

\subsection{Question 1}

The code developed in Part 1 was used to model heat transfer through skin. The skin is split into layers and the heat tranfer through the first three layers was investigated. The spatial domain, $x$, is defined by Figure \ref{fig:skinlayers} where the boundaries are defined as:
\begin{equation*}
 B = 0.01 \ , \ \ D = 0.005 \ , \ \ E  =  0.00166667.
\end{equation*}

The governing equation of heat transfer over the $x$ domain is given by equation \ref{eq:goveqn} where parameters are not consistent between layers and are defined in Table \ref{table:defparams}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:goveqn}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}    = \bigg(\frac{k}{\rho c} \bigg)\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} - \bigg(\frac{G \rho_b c_b}{\rho c}\bigg)T + \bigg(\frac{G \rho_b c_b}{\rho c}\bigg)T_b

\subsection{Question 2}


The function EvalGamma.m shown in Appendix XXX, was created to return the value of $\Gamma$ for a given boundary condition temperature at $x = 0$. The required value of $\Gamma$ to avoid second degree burns is $\Gamma = 1$. From Part 2 Question 1 it was known that a boundary condition of $T(0, t) = 393.15K$ produced a values of Gamma many orders of magnitude greater than $\Gamma = 1$. Furthermore as the temperature which burning occurs is $T_{burn} = 317.15$ it follows that a boundary condition of $T(0, t) = 393.15K$ will produce the result  $\Gamma < 1$. \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Result of FindBC.m XXX. at Each Iteration.}
\label{table:findbc}
\end{table}

A script was made to calculate the value $T(0,t)$ to within 0.5K which would produce a result of $\Gamma = 1$ called XXX.m shown in Appendix XXX. The process followed to find the boundary condition is described by the flow chart in Figure \ref{fig:BCflowchart}. The initial high and low temperature bounds were set at $T(0, t) = 394K$ and $T(0, t) = 316K$ to respectively to give result for $\Gamma$ above and below the target value of $\Gamma = 1$ as previously explained. The process took 8 iterations to find the temperature range of 0.5K which contained the boundary condition, $T(0, t) =T$, which results in $\Gamma = 1$. The range found by was $T(0,t) = 328.5K \ \text{to} \ 328.8K$. \\
 It was difficult to design a more efficient algorithm such as the shooting method to determine the boundary condition due to the extreme non-linearity between $\Gamma$ and $T(0,t)$. The result at each iteration of FindBC.m XXX is shown in Table \ref{table:findbc} and gives insight into how the algorithm arrived at the solution of $T(0, t) =T$. The temperature variation with time at the Epidermis boundary has been plotted at selected iterations in Figure \ref{fig:q22profs}. The boundary condition for each interval in Figure \ref{fig:q22profs} is given by the $T_{av}$ for the corresponding iteration in Table \ref{table:findbc}.
